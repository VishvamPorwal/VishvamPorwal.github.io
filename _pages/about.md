Machine learning and software developer in the making. Over the last two and a half years, I have had the privilege of contributing to diverse domains such as EdTech, ERP Tech, Retail Intelligence, Business Reliability Tech, and AgTech. With an insatiable appetite for learning, I have successfully completed over 40 certifications, constantly seeking new knowledge. I bring a dynamic skill set and a proven track record of delivering impactful solutions.
